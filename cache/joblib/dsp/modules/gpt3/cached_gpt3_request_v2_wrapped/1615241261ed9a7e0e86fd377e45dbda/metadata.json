I can somehow understand this perspective for simpler settings, namely that nonparametric models offer little explanation of the production of the data. However, in more complex models, nonparametric components often are a convenient way to evacuate burdensome nuisance parameters. Again, technical aspects are not the focus of Principles of Applied Statistics, so this also explains why it does not dwell intently on nonparametric models.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: BERT large parameters\\n\\nAnswer:', 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1}"}}
